*** version 3.0.0 PR2 ***

* IO is now comprised of several modules, allowing users to specify and
implement only the needed modules.  These modules are:

- io-base.js: This is the IO base class, using XMLHttpRequest as the transport.
- io-xdr.js: This sub-module extends IO to enable cross-domain transactions
using Flash as the transport.
- io-form.js: This sub-module extends IO to enable the serialization of an HTML
form as transaction data.
- io-upload-iframe.js: This sub-module extends IO, to allow file uploads with an
HTML form, using an iframe transport.
- io-queue.js: This sub-module extends IO to add transaction queuing
capabilities.

* [FIXED] SF2262707.  If defined in the configuration object, user-specified,
HTTP "Content-Type" headers will correctly override POST default headers, for
HTTP POST transactions.

* XML is not supported as a response datatype when using sub-modules io-xdr.js
and io-upload-iframe.js.
