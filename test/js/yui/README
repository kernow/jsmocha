YUI 3.0.0 PR2

This is the second preview release of the components in development for YUI 3.0.0.    
This is not production quality software.  It is an early distribution to allow the
team can get community feedback on the direction we are taking in the development 
of the next major revision to the library.

There are several new additions in this release.

PR2 includes the debut of the Widget infrastructure for 3.0.0.  There are also several
components that make use of Widget: Overlay, Slider, and Console.
	 
The Plugin Infrastructure has also been included in PR2 along with the MenuNav Node Plugin.

In addition, the PR2 release includes updated versions of the YUI Test and Profiler tools 
that are included with the 2.x YUI Library, along with a new Console widget that can be
used for the display of log information.

This release also includes updates to Event, IO, and Node, along with bug fixes in all 
of the components previously released as part of YUI 3.0.0 PR1.  

The YUI 3.x website is located at  http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/.  You will find 
more detailed documentation of these components there as well as number of examples 
demonstrating their use.

Please take some time to review the new design and experiment with these new libraries.
